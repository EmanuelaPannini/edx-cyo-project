The HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course requires the following files for CYO project:

- The report in Rmd format (`CYO.Rmd`)
- The report in PDF format (`CYO.pdf`)
- The code in R format that generates the report (`CYO.R`)

There is also a `bibliography.bib` file, as I decided to keep bibliography separated.
In order to compile the `.Rmd` file, you need to have R and Tex installed on your machine.
